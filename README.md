# Timber Viper Inspired Hobbyweight Combat Robot
## Project Overview
This repo contains the design files and build instructions for a 12lb (hobbyweight) combat robot inspired by the Timber Viper. Our bot features a nasty drum spinner weapon system and a robust, CNC-machined chassis.
### Key Features

    Drum spinner weapon (4" diameter, 10" wide)
    Two-wheel drive with tank steering
    Custom PCB for power distribution (designed in KiCad)
    3D printed components for weight reduction
    Fusion 360 CAD files for all custom parts

### Specs

    Weight class: Hobbyweight (12 lbs / 5.44 kg)
    Dimensions: 14" x 12" x 4" (35.6 cm x 30.5 cm x 10.2 cm)
    Weapon: Drum spinner (S7 tool steel)
    Drive: 2x FingerTech Gold Spark 33.5mm Gearmotors
    Weapon motor: Scorpion HKIV-4025-520KV
    Battery: 4S LiPo (Turnigy Graphene Panther 5000mAh 75C)
    Control: 2.4 GHz RC system (FlySky FS-i6X)

### Repo Structure

    /cad: Fusion 360 files for chassis and weapon
    /pcb: KiCad files for custom power distribution board
    /3d_prints: STL files for 3D printed components
